//ROOM DESCRIPTIONS

Room BC-LandingPad
Name Base Camp: Landing Pad
Description 
Ships fly in low before disgorging their 
small contingent of equipment, supplies, and more rarely, 
people. The landing pads are surrounded with constantly 
swirling dust, driving most new arrivals northward into the 
shelter of the walled camp amidst the featureless wastes.
END

Room BC-CampSquare
Name Base Camp: Camp Square
Description 
The camp bustles with motion. Here 
inside the walls the storm of wind and dust outside is 
subdued, but not entirely abated. If one wanted to get out 
of the blowing grit, they'd likely need to head inside the 
sturdy pre-fabricated buildings that fill the camp. Few 
people cross the square unless traveling between the Landing 
Pads to the south, the barracks to the west, the armory to 
the east, or the camp's gates to the north.

Description 
Guards and emplaced guns keep the camp safe
from outside threats, but once you walk north into the wastes, 
you're on your own. the core of the mercenary camp lies deeper 
behind the walls, south.

Room WL-NearWastes
Name Wastelands: The Near Wastes
Description 
The tamest of the wastelands, this area is high 
in traffic from the mercenary camp, and any larger fauna tend to 
be dealt with swiftly. Only the occasional giant scorpion can be 
found crawling around, attacking people for sustenance - And all 
the juicy water they carry.

Room WL-Wasteland
Name Wastelands: The Wasteland
Description 
A vast expanse of dirt and dust, and little else. These 
rolling hills are blasted by sand - but, plenty more blowing in 
seems to keep the general amount of grit constant. The distant 
camp to the south is a mere shadow, and a deep canyon falls away 
to the west. The wastes grow deeper north, and a faint shape looms 
in the haze to the east.

Room WL-CrashSite
Name Wastelands: Crash Site
Description 
A massive cargo-hauling vessel has crashed into the dunes here. 
It has a large central spine which connects the forward bridge and rear 
engines pods together, both of which tower a half dozen stories tall. 
Hanging from the spine are enormous cargo containers the size of small 
buildings. one pod has a gaping crack in the side.

Room WL-DeepWastes
Name Wastelands: The Deep Wastes
Description 
The terrible blowing winds that howl across the wastes are all 
the worse here. Giant rock formations jut skyward, eerily symmetrical, 
but their shapes do nothing to abate the winds - Possibly even amplifying 
it as dust blows between the pillars.

Room WL-CaveMouth
Name Wastelands: Cave Mouth
Description 
The land almost seems to fall away walking west from the near 
wastes, descending into a miles-wide bowl in the earth. The bowl seems to 
pour north into a deep canyon carved out by a long-forgotten river, but 
tucked away in the bowl's western ridge is a gaping cave mouth, pitch black 
within, that howls in the passing winds.

Room WL-Lookout
Name Wastelands: Lookout
Description 
This high spire allows one to see out over the distant wastes, and 
the massive canyon to the south. Far north, craggy mountains are visible 
through the haze, and a strange, organic-lookign structure nestles among them. 
Far to the east, some sort of crashed vessel can be seen in the sands.

Room CS-BrokenCargoPod
Name Crashed Ship: Broken Cargo Pod
Description 
Inside of the cargo container, the walls are stripped bare - 
Only fitting, given how easy it was to get in here. A seemingly long-broken 
freight elevator leads up to the central corridor in the vessel's spine,
 however the gantry around the broken elevator could be climbed.

down into the cargo pods. The hall continues south towards the engines, and
