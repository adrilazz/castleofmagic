Description 
The camp bustles with motion. Here 
inside the walls the storm of wind and dust outside is 
subdued, but not entirely abated. If one wanted to get out 
of the blowing grit, they'd likely need to head inside the 
sturdy pre-fabricated buildings that fill the camp. Few 
people cross the square unless traveling between the Landing 
Pads to the south, the barracks to the west, the armory to 
the east, or the camp's gates to the north.
